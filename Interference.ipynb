    "# The Double Slit Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we learned about the double slit experiment, which displays the wave-particle duality of quantum particles, such as electrons. When an electron passes through a single slit, it simply passes through and ends up on the other side. From one electron alone, we cannot tell what the probability distribution is for where our electron will be found. When we send many electrons through, however, we can see the underlying probability distribution from the build up of the electrons. *This is much like when we need to measure our qubits many times in order to obtain an estimate of the quantum state. Measuring a qubit once gives us little information.* In the case of one slit, the probability distribution will be non zero across a region with the probability peaked in the center and decaying to the sides.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we add in a second slit, the electron may pass through either slit... and in fact, it will be in a *superposition* of passing through both slits! This means that our electron will *interfere with itself*, exhibiting wave-like behavior. (Of course, when you measure where the electron hits the screen, it displays particle-like behavior again since you only observe it in one place.) In this double slit case, the probability distribution for where we will find the particle will exhibit regions of constructive and destructive interference. The overall amplitude envelope will be peaked in the center and decay out to the sides, but within that there are regions where you are more or less likely to find the electron. Again, measuring only one electron will not tell us anything about the underlying probability distribution, but if we repeat this many times, the electrons will build up, revealing the underlying probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we add in one more twist... What if you watch the electron and observe which slit the electron went through, the probability distribution changes again! We can observe which slit the electron goes through because it is a particle, and a particle can only be seen in one place at one time. In this case, the probability distribution will look like two of the single slit probability distributions laid on top of each other. In practice, since the slits are so close together and the screen is so far away, the distribution looks the same as just one single slit distribution. By observing which slit the electron went through, you *collapsed the electron's wave function* and the electron proceeds to behave particle-like.\n",
