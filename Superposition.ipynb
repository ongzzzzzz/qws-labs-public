A nonuniform magnetic field deflects a magnetic dipole, and the force on the dipole depends upon the overlap between the dipole orientation with the magnetic field orientation. More formally, for magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{m}$ and magnetic field $\\vec{B}$, the force is given by: $\\vec{F} = \\nabla (\\vec{m}\\cdot \\vec{B})$.\n",

    "Our main takeaway here has to do with the amount of deflection of a dipole moment traveling through a region of nonuniform magnetic field. Consider a field oriented in the $z$-direction: $\\vec{B}=B(z)\\hat{z}$ with $B(z)$ increasing with $z$. If the dipole moment is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the deflection will be zero. If the dipole moment points in the $+z$-direction, the deflection will be maximally upwards. If the dipole moment points in the $-z$-direction, the deflection will be maximally downwards. For partial alignment with $\\vec{B}$, the deflection will be somewhere in between.\n",

    "Many quantum objects act like magnetic dipoles due to intrinsic properties such as *spin* and *angular momentum*. We can think of a silver atom, which has non-zero angular momentum, as a magnetic dipole. A silver atom traveling in a nonuniform magnetic field will therefore be deflected. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, they shot silver atoms through a nonuniform magnetic field, let's say $\\vec{B}=B(z)\\hat{z}$. Classically, we would expect that the silver atom's magnetic moment could be anywhere from fully aligned ($\\vec{m} = |m|\\hat{z}$) to fully anti-aligned ($\\vec{m} = -|m|\\hat{z}$) with the field, and there would be a distribution of silver atoms at all possible amounts of deflection. But instead, they observed that the silver atoms deflected only maximally up or down, indicating that the silver atom's magnetic moment could only be $\\vec{m} = \\pm |m|\\hat{z}$. Niels Bohr was right –– magnetic moments are indeed quantized.\n",

    "Now consider a quantum particle which has spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ (and therefore a magnetic moment). An electron is an example of such a particle. We can make a \"Stern-Gerlach machine\" which takes in a particle on the left-side. Since magnetic moments are quantized, the particle's magnetic moment can only be \"up\" or \"down\" with respect to the magnetic field. The machine outputs our particle out of the top port if the magnetic moment is \"up\" and the bottom port if the magnetic moment is \"down.\"\n",

All that is required for BB84 is a quantum channel and a classical communication channel, neither of which need to be secure. We summarize the steps of the protocol here:\n",
