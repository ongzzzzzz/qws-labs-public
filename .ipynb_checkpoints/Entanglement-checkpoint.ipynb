    "## Quantum State Teleportation\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum state teleportation is an elementary protocol in quantum computing that allows one party to send another a quantum state. All it requires is that the parties share a Bell pair (maximally entangled state) and that the sender can locally perform two-qubit gates and send the recipient classical information (such as measurement results).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"background-color:rgba(243, 248, 255, 1.0); text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding:20px 0;border:3px; border-style:solid; padding: 0.5em; border-color: rgba(101, 174, 247, 1.0); color: #000000;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4><strong>The Math Behind Quantum Teleportation</strong></h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the name is suggestive of object transfer, it is a bit misleading. Perhaps a more precise name would be quantum \\textit{information} teleportation. The protocol is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Alice and Bob each receive one qubit of a Bell pair. \n",
    "2. Alice wants to transfer a qubit $\\ket{\\phi}_A=\\alpha\\ket{0}+\\beta\\ket{1}$ to Bob, perhaps over a great spatial distance. In other words, Bob should end up with qubit\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        \\ket{\\phi}_B=\\alpha\\ket{0}+\\beta\\ket{1} \\nonumber\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    that can be manipulated, measured, etc. in the same way as Alice's qubit $\\ket{\\phi}_A$.\n",
    "3. Because Alice has two qubits, they can perform a *Bell measurement* on them, as if one were trying to determine which of the four Bell states the two Alice qubits are in.\n",
    "4. Half of the time, this turns out to send Bob's qubit into a superposition that, within a local phase flip, looks like $\\ket{\\phi}_A$:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        \\ket{\\phi}_B=\\alpha\\ket{0}\\pm\\beta\\ket{1} \\nonumber\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    Thus, Bob can apply a Z gate if needed to bring $\\ket{\\phi}_B$ to the desired superposition. What about the other half of the time? The result is a little more complicated\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        \\ket{\\phi}_B=\\alpha\\ket{1}\\pm\\beta\\ket{0} \\nonumber\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    but it can be seen that with judicious application of an additional bit-flip (X gate), this becomes identical to the previous case requiring a local phase flip.\n",
    "5. How does Bob know whether or not to apply an X or Z gate or both? It turns out that the bit-flip and relative phase depends on which of the four Bell states Alice measured. Thus, Alice also needs to transfer two *classical* bits, corresponding to the measurement results from Step 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "The circuit for the procotol can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/entanglement/quantum_tele_circuit.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, one could conceive of simply sending a $\\ket{\\phi}$ encoded photon to Bob. The key is that with quantum teleportation, Alice never even has to do that! Remember, the Bell pair could be coming from someone else entirely, a third party. Instead, Alice only ever needs to transmit classical information to Bob (which unfortunately, does limit the communication to the speed of light).\n",
    "\n",
    "It might seem like this protocol appears out of nowhere. The key intuition here is that _the four Bell states form a complete basis for a two-qubit composite system._ Thus, even though Alice's qubits may not be in a maximally-entangled state, they can always be decomposed into a superposition of Bell states. Roughly speaking, this suggests the full Alice-Bob three-qubit composite system may be able to be factorized as a tensor product of the Alice Bell-state decomposition, times Bob's qubit, with weights related to $\\ket{\\phi}_A$. Measurement then projects Bob's qubit into the desired state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the shared entangled state between Alice and Bob is the Bell state $\\ket{\\Phi^+}$. Then the full composite system is given by:\n",
    "$$\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\ket{\\phi}_A \\ket{\\Phi^+}_{AB} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\alpha\\ket{0}_A\\pm\\beta\\ket{1}_A)(\\ket{0}_A\\ket{0}_B+\\ket{1}_A\\ket{1}_B)\n",
    "\\end{equation}$$\n",
    "where the subscripts indicate whom the qubits belong to. Then, decomposing Alice's qubits in the Bell basis, we obtain\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\ket{\\phi}_A \\ket{\\Phi^+}_{AB} = \\frac{1}{2}[&\\ket{\\Phi^+}_A(\\alpha\\ket{0}_B+\\beta\\ket{1}_B) \\nonumber \\\\ + &\\ket{\\Phi^-}_A(\\alpha\\ket{0}_B-\\beta\\ket{1}_B) \\nonumber \\\\ + &\\ket{\\Psi^+}_A(\\alpha\\ket{1}_B+\\beta\\ket{0}_B) \\nonumber \\\\ + &\\ket{\\Psi^-}_A(\\alpha\\ket{1}_B-\\beta\\ket{0}_B)]\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "In both a mathematical and physical sense, the probability amplitudes of $\\ket{\\phi}_A$ \"transfer over\" to Bob's qubit. It is clear then that each Bell state is associated with a particular Bob qubit state that needs to be communicated to ensure the proper phase relation between $\\ket{0}_B$ and $\\ket{1}_B$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We summarize the four possible Bell state measurement results for Alice and Bob's required manipulations in the following table:\n",

    "# Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguably the simplest \"algorithm\" in quantum computing is the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which outperforms the best classical algorithm. The issue at hand is to determine whether a function is $f: \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow {0,1}$ is constant or balanced. In other words, $f$ takes as an input a length $n$ bitstring and outputs either 0 or 1 for each input. If $f$ is constant, it always outputs the same answer. If $f$ is balanced, then it outputs 0 for exactly half of the inputs and 1 for the other half.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, the worst case scenario is we would need to check the output of $f$ for half of the number of bitsrings plus one. This is because, for example, if we measure half of the outputs to be 0, then we would need to measure one more input to be certain whether this $f$ is constant or balanced. So classically, worst case scenario, we need to make $2^{n-1} + 1$ queries of $f$. With the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a quantum computer, however, we can always determine whether $f$ is constant or balanced in a *single query*!\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Deutsch Jozsa algorithm, we need to translate $f$ to something a quantum computer can understand. So we encode $f$ into a unitary $U_f$ which acts on an $n+1$ qubit system (where $n$ is the length of the inputs to $f$). We do not count any extra gates needed for the circuit, such as $H$ gates, towards the number of queries –– only the number of times $U_f$ is applied."

    "\n",
    "To put this a bit more mathematically, the problem is as follows. The black box acts as a function $f(x): \\{0,1,\\dots, N\\} \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}$, where $f(x)=1$ if and only if $x$ is the \"success\" input and $f(x)=0$ otherwise.\n",

Let's get into the details.\n",

    "Design a protocol to reconstruct the unitary matrix for a one-qubit unitary operator. You may create as many quantum circuits as you'd like. You may use `statevector.evolve(u)` but you may not investigate other properties of the `u` variable. Reuse your quantum state tomography and pure state recovery protocols from above. How many times do you need to run quantum state tomography?\n",

    "* To obtain the computational basis vectors, use `statevector = Statevector.from_int(i, 2**n)`.\n",
    "* You can compute the result of the circuit (as a density matrix) by invoking `output_dm = DensityMatrix(statevector.evolve(u))`. Do not directly access `statevector.evolve(u)` as a statevector.\n",
    "* To find $|u_i\\rangle$ from the reconstructed density matrix $\\rho_i \\approx |u_i\\rangle\\langle u_i|$ requires some work, as in the previous challenge problem. Due to the imprecision of this reconstruction process, you will have to find eigenstates $|u_{ik}\\rangle$ of $\\rho_i$ such that $\\rho_i = \\sum_k p_k |u_{ik}\\rangle\\langle u_{ik}|$ where $\\sum_k p_k = 1$. If your density matrix reconstruction is well-behaved, one of the $p_k$ will be much larger than the others and the corresponding $|u_{ik}\\rangle$ is a good guess for $|u_{i}\\rangle$, up to a phase factor.\n",
    "* Keep an eye out for phase! When you reconstruct $U$ from the $|u_{i}\\rangle$, some of the columns might need an extra phase factor in relation to one another. Just sampling the computational basis is insufficient. You can assume that $U_{0,0} \\in \\mathbb{R}$."
